During a traditional Thai massage the body is moved into a series of yoga-like stretches. Hands, elbows, knees, and feet are used for ‘massaging’ the energy line network. Muscle compression, joint mobilization, and acupressure are part of this treatment. Many people say Thai massage is like doing yoga without any work. People describe Thai massage as both relaxing and energizing. Thai Reflexology/Foot massage is also being offered. It incorporates deep, smooth strokes on feet and lower legs using Thai herbs infused lotion. Metta is a Thai word meaning “loving kindness”. That is the environment that makes Thai massage truly special. Thai massage has been around for more than 1000 years, but is only recently becoming more popular in the United States. Reflexology is a therapeutic foot massage originally practiced in China. Its based on the theory that pressure applied to points on the foot can activate another body part, thus promoting healing."
